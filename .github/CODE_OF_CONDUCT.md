# Service Standards & Code of Conduct

## 1. The Ironclad Covenant
By deploying Urchin on Tarantula Tech infrastructure or contributing to this repository, you agree to these binding terms. We prioritize integrity, stability, and legality above all else.

## 2. Zero-Tolerance Policy (Acceptable Use)
We maintain a **strict, non-negotiable prohibition** on illegal and malicious activities.

**Immediate Termination with Prejudice** will occur if your instance is found hosting, facilitating, or promoting:
* **Illegal Content:** Including but not limited to CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material), non-consensual intimate imagery, or acts of terrorism.
* **Fraud & Deception:** Phishing, scamming, ponzi schemes, or organized financial fraud.
* **Malicious Engineering:** Botnets, malware distribution, or denial-of-service (DDoS) orchestration.

**Enforcement:**
Upon detection of any violation listed above, Tarantula Tech reserves the right to:
1.  **Block:** Immediately suspend your server instance without prior warning.
2.  **Purge:** Irreversibly delete all associated data.
3.  **Report:** Forward all relevant logs and identity data to appropriate law enforcement agencies.

## 3. Operational Liability & Deployment
Urchin is a consensus engine designed for high-stakes environments, but **you remain the architect of your own risk.**

* **"As-Is" Deployment:** We provide the infrastructure and the runtime. We are **not responsible** for damages, data loss, or community fallout resulting from unstable versions, experimental branches, or misconfigured deployments you choose to run.
* **Two-Person Integrity (TPI):** The effectiveness of the TPI system relies on the humans operating it. We are not liable for collusion between your staff members.

## 4. Resource Integrity
To ensure stability for all tenants, the following technical abuse is prohibited:
* **Crypto-Mining:** Using compute cycles for proof-of-work calculations.
* **High-Frequency Spam:** Using the API to intentionally flood Discord/Telegram gateways.

## 5. Governance
We reserve the right to audit running instances for compliance with these terms. This document may be amended to preserve the security and legal standing of the hosting service.
